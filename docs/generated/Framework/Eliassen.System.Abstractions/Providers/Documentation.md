```
This diagram shows the relationship between IDateTimeProvider and IGuidProvider, indicating that a concrete implementation of IDateTimeProvider may also implement IGuidProvider.

Please note that since these are interfaces, there is no concrete implementation provided in the given code files. The class diagrams and relationship diagram are generated based on the interface definitions.
