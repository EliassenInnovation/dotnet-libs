**README.md**

**Summary**

The provided files are part of a .NET 8.0 project for testing search functionality. The project contains a test project (`Eliassen.Search.Tests.csproj`) that uses MSTest as the testing framework. The project references two other projects: `Eliassen.Search` and `Eliassen.TestUtilities`. The purpose of this project is to test the search functionality and provide coverage reports using Coverlet.

**Technical Summary**

The design pattern used in this project is the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, where tests are written before the implementation of the search functionality. The project utilizes the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, with the test project being responsible for testing the business logic of the search functionality.

**Component Diagram**

```plantuml
@startuml
class EliassenSearch {
  - searchFunctionality: string
}

class EliassenTestUtilities {
  - utilityMethods: list[string]
}

class EliassenSearchTests {

The component diagram shows the relationships between the classes in the project:

* `EliassenSearch` contains the search functionality and is responsible for executing the search.
* `EliassenTestUtilities` contains utility methods for testing and is used by the test project.
* `EliassenSearchTests` is the test project that tests the search functionality using the TDD approach. It references `EliassenSearch` and `EliassenTestUtilities` to perform the tests.

The arrows indicate the relationships between the classes: `EliassenSearchTests` uses `EliassenSearch` and `EliassenTestUtilities` to perform the tests, and `EliassenSearch` uses `EliassenSearch.searchFunctionality` to execute the search.
