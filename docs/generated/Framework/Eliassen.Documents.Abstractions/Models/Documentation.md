Properties:

* `ContentType`: Gets or initializes the content type of the content.
* `FileName`: Gets or initializes the file name associated with the content.
* `MetaData`: Gets or initializes the metadata associated with the content (optional).

**ContentReference.cs**

Summary:
Represents a content reference containing information about content such as a stream, content type, and file name.

Description:
This class represents a content reference, which contains information about the content, including a stream, content type, and file name.

Properties:

* `Content`: Gets or initializes the content stream.
* `ContentType`: Gets or initializes the content type.
* `FileName`: Gets or initializes the file name associated with the content.

**DocumentType.cs**

Summary:
Represents a document type, including its name, supported content types, file extensions, and file header.

Description:
This class represents a document type, which includes its name, supported content types, file extensions, and file header. It also implements the `IDocumentType` interface.

Properties:

* `Name`: Gets or sets the name of the document type.
* `ContentTypes`: Gets or sets the MIME content types supported by this document type.
* `FileExtensions`: Gets or sets the file extensions commonly associated with this document type.
* `FileHeader`: Gets or sets the unique byte sequence at the beginning of files of this type.

**IDocumentType.cs**

Summary:
Represents a document type.

Description:
This interface represents a document type, which includes its name, supported content types, file extensions, and file header.

Properties:

* `Name`: Gets the name of the document type.
* `ContentTypes`: Gets the supported content types for documents of this type.
* `FileExtensions`: Gets the supported file extensions for documents of this type.
* `FileHeader`: Gets the file header bytes that identify documents of this type.

**Class Diagrams**

Here are the class diagrams generated using Plant UML:

```
@startuml
class ContentMetaDataReference {
  - Content-Type: string
  - File-Name: string
  - Meta-Data: Dictionary<string, string>?
}

class ContentReference {
  - Content: Stream
  - Content-Type: string
  - File-Name: string
}

class DocumentType {
  - Name: string
  - Content-Types: string[]
  - File-Extensions: string[]
  - File-Header: byte[]
}

interface IDocumentType {
  - Name: string
  - Content-Types: string[]
  - File-Extensions: string[]
  - File-Header: byte[]
}

ContentMetaDataReference --* ContentReference
DocumentType --* IDocumentType
@enduml
```

```
@startuml
class DocumentType implements IDocumentType {
  - Name: string
  - Content-Types: string[]
  - File-Extensions: string[]
  - File-Header: byte[]
}

class ContentReference {
  - Content: Stream
  - Content-Type: string
  - File-Name: string
}

ContentReference --* DocumentType
@enduml
```

These diagrams show the relationships between the classes and interfaces. The first diagram shows the inheritance relationship between `DocumentType` and `IDocumentType`, as well as the reference relationship between `ContentMetaDataReference` and `ContentReference`. The second diagram shows the reference relationship between `ContentReference` and `DocumentType`.
