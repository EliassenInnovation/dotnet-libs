**Class Diagram**

Here is a class diagram for the Eliassen.AspNetCore.Tests project in PlantUML:
```
@startuml
class Tests {
  - testProject: string
  - packageReferences: string[]
  - projectReferences: ProjectReference[]
}

class ProjectReference {
  - projectProjectPath: string
}

Tests --* ProjectReference
Tests --* packageReferences
packageReferences --* MSTest.TestAdapter
packageReferences --* MSTest.TestFramework
packageReferences --* coverlet.collector

This diagram shows the classes and relationships in the Eliassen.AspNetCore.Tests project. The `Tests` class represents the test project and has relationships with the `ProjectReference` class, which represents the project references in the project. The `ProjectReference` class has a property for the project path. The `Tests` class also has relationships with the package references, which are represented by the `packageReferences` array. The package references are related to the `MSTest.TestAdapter`, `MSTest.TestFramework`, and `coverlet.collector` classes.

I hope this documentation and class diagram help to provide an overview of the Eliassen.AspNetCore.Tests.csproj file.
