Here is the documentation for the `Accessor.cs` file, along with a class diagram in PlantUML:

**Code Documentation:**

**Accessor.cs**

The `Accessor<T>` class represents an accessor for a value of type `<typeparamref name="T"/>`. It implements the `IAccessor<T>` interface and provides a simple way to access and modify the value associated with the accessor.

**Properties:**

* `Value`: Gets or sets the value associated with this accessor.

**Constructors:**

None.

**Methods:**

None.

**Implemented Interfaces:**

* `IAccessor<T>`: Provides a simple way to access and modify the value associated with the accessor.

**Dependencies:**

* `AsyncLocal<T?>`: A private field that stores the value associated with the accessor.

**Notes:**

* This class is internal and can only be accessed from within the Eliassen.Extensions.Accessors namespace.
* The `Value` property uses an `AsyncLocal<T?>` to store and retrieve the value associated with the accessor. This allows the accessor to be thread-safe and to maintain its state across async operations.
