Here is the documentation for the source code files:

**Eliassen.Extensions.Tests.csproj**

* This is a .NET Core project file for a test project.
* The project targets .NET 8.0.
* The `ImplicitUsings` property is set to `false`, which means that all using statements must be explicitly included in the code.
* The `Nullable` property is set to `enable`, which allows Nullable Reference Types (NRTs) in the project.
* The `IsPackable` property is set to `false`, which means that this project cannot be packed into a NuGet package.
* The `IsTestProject` property is set to `true`, which indicates that this project is a test project.

**StringToolsTests.cs**

* This is a test class in the `Eliassen.Extensions.Tests` namespace, which is responsible for testing the `StringTools` class.
* The test class consists of a single test method, `Test`, which takes two parameters: `input` and `expected`.
* The `input` parameter is a string that is to be processed by the `StringTools` class, while the `expected` parameter is the expected output of the processing.
* The test method uses the `SplitBy` and `WriteAsLines` methods of the `StringTools` class to process the input string, and then asserts that the result is equal to the expected output using the `Assert.AreEqual` method.
* The test method is decorated with attributes from the `Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting` namespace, including `TestClass`, `TestCategory`, `DataTestMethod`, and `DataRow`. These attributes indicate that this test class is a unit test, that it belongs to the "Unit" test category, and that it uses data-driven testing to test multiple inputs and expected outputs.

Here is a Class Diagram generated using PlantUML:
```
@startuml
class StringToolsTests {
  -private TestContext testContext
  -TestContext get_testContext()
  -void Test(string input, string expected)
}

class StringTools {
  -string SplitBy(int length)
  -string WriteAsLines()
}

StringToolsTests --* StringTools
@enduml
```
This diagram shows the relationships between the `StringToolsTests` class and the `StringTools` class. The `StringToolsTests` class has a private field `testContext` and a method `Test` that takes two parameters, `input` and `expected`. The `StringTools` class has two methods, `SplitBy` and `WriteAsLines`, which are called by the `Test` method in the `StringToolsTests` class.
