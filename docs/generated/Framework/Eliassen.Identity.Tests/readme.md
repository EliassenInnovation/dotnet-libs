**README File for Eliassen.Identity.Tests Project**

**Summary:**

The Eliassen.Identity.Tests project is a test suite for the Eliassen.Identity project, which likely consists of identity-related functionality for authentication and authorization. This project contains unit tests, integration tests, and possibly other types of tests, all written in C# and targeting the .NET 8.0 framework.

**Technical Summary:**

The project uses Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk as the test framework, with MSTest.TestAdapter and MSTest.TestFramework as additional dependencies. The tests cover the Eliassen.Identity project, which is referenced as a project reference. The project also includes the coverlet.collector package, which is used for code coverage analysis.

**Design and Architectural Patterns:**

The project appears to follow a simple and straightforward structure, with a focus on unit testing and integration testing. The use of MSTest and the Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk framework suggests a traditional testing approach. The reference to the Eliassen.Identity project implies a dependency injection or service-based architecture, where the tests are used to verify the behavior of the identity-related services.
