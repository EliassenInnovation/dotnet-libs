# Eliassen.Identity.Tests Documentation

## Purpose

This project is a test suite for the Eliassen.Identity library, designed to verify the functionality and behavior of the library's components.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files and folders:

* `Eliassen.Identity.Tests.csproj`: The project file for the test suite, which contains references to the Eliassen.Identity library and the necessary test frameworks.
* `Test Classes`: A folder containing test classes that correspond to the different components of the Eliassen.Identity library.

* MSTest.TestFramework (version 3.4.3)
* coverlet.collector (version 6.0.2)

## Architecture

The project follows a test-driven development (TDD) approach, where the tests are written first and then the code is implemented to meet the requirements specified in the tests.

The project has the following components:

* `Eliassen.Identity`: A separate project containing the Eliassen.Identity library
* `Eliassen.Identity.Tests`: This project, which contains the test suite for the Eliassen.Identity library
